DataBridge is a Drupal 7.x module developed in 2011 by Martin Norling of the 
International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Nairobi Kenya. 

The module extracts data from the LIMS system used by the AVID project at ILRI
so that the data can easily be used by other modules. This module may not be 
immediately useful in any other context without tweaking but hopefully it can
be used as a base for other projects.
